# Aneurysm-Analysis-App-Prototype
This is a complete prototype of a mobile app, which measures and visualises the state of aneurysms.

This is a project, in which I took part with my team @ OvGU Magdeburg in the <i>Interactive Systems</i> course. We developed it based on our assignment to build a functional prototype of a mobile app, which analyses data for the state of a aneurysm in a clinical patient. 

The implementation of this prototype can be used for research puroposes as well as for an app that can be easily implemented in the smart devices of doctors, which are observing their patients.

Enjoy the app and feel free to contact me, if you are interested in this project!
